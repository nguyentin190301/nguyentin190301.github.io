I am a fourth-year Computer Science PhD Candidate at the University of Maryland, College Park (UMD), fortunately advised by [Prof. Hal Daumé III](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~hal/) and [Prof. Zubin Jelveh](https://zjelveh.github.io/), who care and foster conceptual creativity. The broad theme of my PhD research is incorporating insights from law and moral philosophy to audit for and enable fairer attribution of responsibility in collaborative human-AI systems. The first category of "responsibility’' is "burden", e.g., 1/ decision subjects’ burden of bearing unfavorable and potentially erroneous decisions and 2/ decision makers’ burden of potentially suffering more when AI assistance is given (compared to when they make decisions alone). The second category of "responsibility’' is "blame", e.g., when a human-AI system decides or generates something wrong, how to fairly determine whom to blame?

Regarding research methods, through PhD and internship work, I have got experience in and been further refining three distinct but complementary methods: \\
1/ formulating new arguments based on primary legal sources (Law); \\
2/ designing human subject experiments and statistical analyses of their results (HCI); \\
3/ scraping online text, building classification models, fine-tuning language models against harmful content and measuring the quality of such fine-tuning (technical NLP/ML).

I am on the industry job market this year! I look for a full-time, U.S.-based AI x Law position (starting late May or late August, 2026 through OPT) such as: \\
1/ Technology Specialist at IP/patent law firms \\
2/ Research Scientist/Research Engineer at tech companies with a meaningful policy/legal component
